# Pizza Manager 3000

## Overview

This is a simple pizza management application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It allows you to manage pizzas and their toppings.

Supabase and Next.js were chosen because:

- I am familiar with both technologies, allowing for rapid development
- Both were free to use
